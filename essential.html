            <p>"The Big Sleep" - 1946 - Directed by Howard Hawks</p>
            <img id="sleep" src= "images/sleep.jpg">
            <p id="synopsis" > Starring Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe, the most iconic
                 private detective in noir, investigating a blackmail racket targeting a 
                 frail elderly man and his two reckless daughters (one of which, Vivian
                 Regan, played by Lauren Bacall) who're entangled with the most dangerous
                 and powerful men of the city's underworld. Based on Raymond Chandler's
                 1939 novel. Famous for it's impossible to follow, convaluted plot, is 
                 the definitive film noir.

        <div class="box box2">2
            <p>"Double Indemnity" - 1944 - Directed by Billy Wilder</p>
            <img id="double" src= "images/double.jpg">
            <p id="synopsis" > Fred Macmurray bleeds from a gunshot wound as he recounts
                 Barbara Stanwyck's attempt to claim a big payout on her husband's 
                 'accidental' death. Has almost every element considered classic noir
                 including two doomed characters falling helplessly into each other's
                 arms, moments after meeting, to disasterous consequences.

        </div>

        <div class="box box3">3
            <p>"Sunset Boulevard" - 1950 - Directed by Billy Wilder</p>
            <img id="sunset" src= "images/sunset2.jpg"> 
            <p id="synopsis" > One of the greatest films ever. Although not always considered 
                'classic noir', is more bleak and more cynical than almost any other.
                Starring Gloria Swanson as a reclusive and depraved silent movie actor 
                in the age of talking pictures and William Holden as a struggling 
                screenwriter who tries to revive her career. "You're Norma Desmond.
                You used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big." - "I am big. 
                It's the pictures that got small." </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box4">4
            <p>"The Maltese Falcon" - 1941 - Directed by John Huston</p>
            <img id="falcon" src= "images/falcon2.jpg">
            <p id= "synopsis" > Starring Humphrey Bogart as private detective Sam Spade, 
                with Mary Astor, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. One of the most
                famous examples in cinema of a Macguffin as three untrustworthy
                characters desperately chase a suposedly priceless object for the 
                purpose of advancing the story and developing the suspense. "The stuff
                dreams are made of."

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box5">5
            <p>"Sweet Smell of Success" - 1957 - Directed by Alexander Mackendrick</p>
            <img id="sweet" src= "images/sweet.jpg">
            <p id="synopsis" > One of the 'coolest' films ever with one of the greatest
                screenplays. Burt Lancaster is a ruthless newspaper columnist and Tony
                Curtis plays a shameless and frustrated press agent. "The next time you
                want information, don't scratch for it like a dog, ask for it like a man!"
            </p> 
        </div>

        <div class="box box6">6
            <p>"In a Lonely Place" - 1950 - Directed by Nicholas Ray </p>
            <img id= "lonely2" src= "images/lonely2.jpg">
            <p id= "synopsis" > Humphrey Bogart plays a wild-tempered screenwriter suspected
                of murder, with Gloria Grahame playing a neighbour who falls in love with
                him. One of the moodiest and most suspenseful films from the time. Many
                noirs have one or two intriguing elements, but this is entertaining 
                throughout. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box7">7
            <p>"Kiss Me Deadly" - 1955 - Directed by Robert Aldrich</p>
            <img id="kiss" src= "images/kiss.jpg">
            <p id= "synopsis" > An evolution in noir as the plot tackles nuclear threat
                rather than post-war cynicism. One of the most influential films of the
                genre, including inspiring the mysterious glowing box in "Pulp Fiction".
                Starring Ralph Meeker, Albert Dekker and Cloris Leachman in her film debut. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box8">8
             <p>"The Big Heat" - 1953 - Directed by Fritz Lang</p>
            <img id= "big" src= "images/big.jpg">
            <p 
            id= "synopsis" > One of the most entertaining and violent noirs. Most notable 
            for Lee Marvin throwing a pot of hot coffee in Gloria Grahame's face. Glenn Ford
            stars as a cop investigating a suspicious suicide of another officer that leads
            to him taking on a ruthless crime syndicate. A much better film than Ford's more
            celebrated noir 'Gilda' with Rita Hayworth. 
           </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box box9">9
            <p>"Laura" 1944 - Directed by Otto Preminger</p>
            <img id= "laura" src= "images/laura.jpg">
            <p 
            id= "synopsis" >Regarded as one of the greatest mysteries in film, and with the
            plot being so convulted and the style so strange, the details revealed are all 
            quickly forgotten. The most memorable elements are the stylised aesthetic, Gene 
            Tierney as Laura and Clifton Webb as Waldo Lydecker, a newspaper columnist, with
            such lines as "I don't use a pen. I write with a goose quill dipped in venom."
            </p>

        <div class="box box10" >10
            <p> 
          "Touch of Evil" - 1958 - Directed by Orson Welles
            </p> 
            <img id= "touch" src= "images/touch.jpg"> 
            <p
            id="synopsis" >Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietrich star with Orson
            Welles in his directing return to Hollywood after over a decade in European 
            exile. Considered one of his and classic noir's last great films. Despite Charlton
            Heston being bizzarly cast as a Mexican Government official named Miguel Vargas
            who investigates a car bombing across the Mexican-American border. Most notable
            for the three-minute opening scene, considered one of the greatest long take's 
            in cinema.
